# Chapter 1

## compile & execute in command line
1. g++ main.cpp(enable possible warnings,use g++ -Wall,e.g.Warnings All)
  - g++ -o result main.cpp (in this way,generate execute file **result**;default **a.out**)
2. ./a.out ('/'use in linux & '\'use in Win;to execute,we need to specify the current location:'./')
3. echo $?(to see status,e.g. return 0 or else)

## iostream(Standard Library)  
1. #include<iostream>  to use iostream
2. cin & cout define in the namespace std,so if without "using namespace std",it will be std::cin、std:cout、std::endl
3. cin>>val cout<<val,both of them return the **lefthand**,e.g. if input is an int,then cin>>val  succeed to read an int into val,then return true;
   so we can use  while(cin>>val) to keep record the input when input is an int.

## comments
1. single-line: //   end with a new line
2. paired: /*  * /   when span multiple lines, it is better to use * in every line  
   note:this type can't appear inside again.it will result in mysterious errors.

## flow of control
1.for(i=0;i<100;i++), when you want to iterate by 2 not 1,use while in which i=i+2;

## class
1. every class defines a type,likewise structure.The type name is class name.eg,we define a class Sales_item,
   and Sales_item item,means we define item as a object of type Sales_item,just like the built-in types.
2. some languages just allow to define types that specify only what data make up the type;
  c++ allow operator as well as data.

## others
1. sum += val  e.g.sum=sum+val;
2. Headers from Standard Library are enclosed in <>;Other headers(we difine) are enclosed in "".
