## G Rating
G Rated movies are intended for **General Audiences**, with all ages admitted. To the MPAA, G ratings are most notable for what the films **don’t include** – no sex and nudity, substance abuse, or realistic/non-cartoon violence.(很干净啥都没有)

##PG Rating
A PG movie rating stands for **Parental Guidance**, as some material may not be suitable for children. There may be **mild strong language and some violence, but there will not be substance use or abuse**.（轻度脏话和暴力，无嗑药）

##PG-13 Rating
PG-13 rated movies stand for **Parental Guidance-13**, with parents strongly cautioned, as some material may not be suitable for children **under 13**. Again, it’s a matter of what isn’t in the film; **any nudity has to be non-sexual, any swear words have to be used sparingly, and, in the event of the specific obscenity we politely call the F-word, not used in a sexual context**.（非性的裸体，性片段不用fuck）

##R Rating
Rated R movies mean **Restricted**, with no one under **17** admitted without an accompanying parent or guardian. This rating is given for strong and frequent language and violence, nudity for sexual purposes and drug abuse.（17下没有父母监督不可，强烈频繁脏话和暴力，性目的裸体和嗑药）

## NC-17 Rating
Movies with an NC-17 rating mean **No one under 18 admitted**. This rare rating is given to films which feature mature elements in such profusion – or in such intensity – that it surpasses even the R. **The MPAA bases this rating on the assumption that most parents would not want children to see this material without supervision – and, of course, it’s their definition of “Most parents.**（哈哈哈））”（成人电影，艺术为主）
